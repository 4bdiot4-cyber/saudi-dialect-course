# PROFESSIONAL SAUDI DIALECT ACADEMY
## Complete Implementation Blueprint

Based on proven language learning methodologies from Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and Babbel.

---

## REALISTIC TIME COMMITMENT
- **Total Course Duration**: 12-18 months at 30 min/day
- **Not** 1h45m to fluency (that was embarrassingly amateur)
- Scaffolded progression: A1 → A2 → B1 → B2
